biblatex-academic - A biblatex style for academics
==================================================

The `biblatex-academic` package provides a biblatex style for lists of things
an academic might like to list in a CV or lab whitepaper (students, alumni,
collaborators, proposals, projects, courses, etc.). This implementation follows
standard `biblatex` conventions, and can be used simply by loading `biblatex`
with the appropriate options:

    \usepackage[backend=biber,bibstyle=academic]{biblatex}

The `biblatex-academic` style requires `biblatex` 2.7a or later, the
`biblatex-ieee` style, and requires Biber as the database back-end.
