\title{The \pkg{academic} bibliography style for \pkg{biblatex}%

\maketitle

The \pkg{biblatex-academic} package provides a \pkg{biblatex} style for lists of things an academic might like to list in a CV or lab whitepaper (students, alumni, collaborators, proposals, projects, courses, etc.).
This implementation follows standard \pkg{biblatex} conventions, and can be used simply by loading \pkg{biblatex} with the appropriate options:
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage[backend=biber,bibstyle=academic]{biblatex}
\end{verbatim}
The \pkg{biblatex-academic} style requires \pkg{biblatex} 2.7a or later, requires \pkg{Biber} as the database back-end, and the following packages/styles: \pkg{biblatex-ieee}, \pkg{graphicx}, \pkg{siunitx}, \pkg{calc}, \pkg{hyperref}, and \pkg{wrapfig}.
